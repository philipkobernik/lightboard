# LIGHTBOARD 🎹🏮

### PRESENT

0. install node, clone the repo, run `npm install` to install dependencies
1. plug a midi keyboard into your system
2. `npm run start`
3. 5 octaves (60 keys) will now map to colors 0-360 degrees on the color temperature wheel

### FUTURE

* throttle messages to avoid 'overwhelming' the lights
* enable chords with 2 or more lights working independently
* invent sounds for colors
* keyboard (or other color-controller) triggers sounds specifically composed for the associated color
