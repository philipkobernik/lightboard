# LIGHTBOARD

### PRESENT

1. plug a midi keyboard into your system
2. `npm run start`
3. 5 octaves (60 keys) will now map to colors 0-360 degrees on the color temperature wheel

### FUTURE

* invent sounds for colors
* keyboard (or other color-controller) triggers sounds specifically composed for the associated color
